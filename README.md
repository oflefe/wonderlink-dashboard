## Prerequisites

- Docker, Docker desktop, docker compose (if applicable): this is to spin up the postgres instance. If you'd rather use your own postgres instance, then change `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` with your database connection string.
- Nodejs and npm

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Run database: 
```bash
docker compose up 
```
